            Vocab Village is an immersive virtual reality experience designed to enhance vocabulary learning for young students who are learning English as a second langauge. We use OpenAI's Whisper API for our speech-to-text feature so students can practice pronounciation of words.

                    This project was created for my capstone course on developing XR applications for social good. My group chose to create an educational vocabulary learning app for young students learning English as a second language. We utilized OpenAI's speech-to-text capabilities as our core feature for students to use as a pronounciation tool. As our app is targeted towards a younger audience, we tried to incorporate a friendly mascot and created an intriguing narrative to build an intrinsic motivation to learn. 
                    <br><br>
                    As part of the class, we also did extensive research, playtested our app with other groups, interviewed potential stakeholders, and marketed our product by creating a trailer.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, I thought this was a very fun and interesting idea and with more time, we could have definitely polished the app a lot more and included more levels.
