        <p>This project was created as a group of 4 and submitted to the Lightship Real-World AR Challenge of 2023.
            <br><br>

            Our project, "Huh!? Iâ€™ve Been Hired By Alien Researchers", is an AR Language learning world exploration game meant to motivate users to one of the most tedious parts of language learning, memorizing vocabulary. Players are introduced to the ICRC, the Interplanetary Communications Research Company whose aim is to solve language barrier problems by studying how human brains memorize words. Dr. Zero, their boss, offers you a job to help them!

            One of the inspirations for our application was the multitude of studies on memory retention ability during exercise. After reading and cross-referencing numerous papers, similar conclusions have been drawn: information retention is increased during light to moderate aerobic exercise. Adding to this, there are also studies about the positive correlation of spacing out memorization between different sessions. Taking these ideas and world exploration into account, we were inspired to create an application for memorizing foreign vocabulary while walking from place to place, aiming for better word retention.
