        <p>This is a group project done by 5 students. <br><br>
            Our idea is to build a fitness app that encourages people to stay active through fun games and interactions. An activity we have currently implemented is tennis. All our users will need is a mobile device and a separate laptop/desktop screen. With this, users will be able perform physical activities within the comfort of their own home with devices they already have, making it an accessible service for many. Regarding the technical aspect, our project desires to take advantage of our phonesâ€™ motion sensors to track player arm movements and actions. 
            <br><br>Our app also aims to connect users through our multiplayer feature, as we want users to have fun with their friends while staying fit. Users will have to host a match on their computer on the local network, and then join as player clients on their mobile devices. We want to create software that allows people to easily connect in new ways. After the pandemic, many people have been negatively affected in forming social bonds, and so, by creating an easy-to-use and accessible app, users can use this app as a stepping stone to create memories.
            <br><br>We used Unity to build our app, Unity Netcode for our multiplayer feature, and Blender for our models.
            <br><br>Here is a video of our demo:
