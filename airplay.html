                    In traditional sport and entertainment settings, players with mobility disabilities typically do not have opportunities to engage in physical play with their peers without disabilities and vice versa due to physical and social barriers. Addressing these barriers is critical for reducing the risk of developing serious health problems and secondary health conditions, such as pain, fatigue, depression and obesity, as well as for increasing a sense of empowerment, normalcy, and acquisition of social capital.
                    <br><br>
                    The key idea behind the AiR Play project is to remove these barriers to play by combining some of the elements and well-known benefits of adaptive sports and sports in general with the whole-body interaction modalities of exergames to create an inclusive, projected augmented reality (AiR) game environment that is accessible and enjoyable for people of all abilities.
