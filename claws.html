        <p>CLAWS is a multi-disciplinary group of 60 undergraduate and graduate students that has competed in the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Challenge since 2018. The team builds augmented reality (AR) interfaces to assist astronauts in their exploration of the lunar surface. CLAWS members have the opportunity to learn and apply industry skills in a collaborative project team, and engage with the broader space community.
            <br><br>As part of the AR subteam, I am responsible for developing the spatial interfaces created by the UX Team. This involves front-end development (developing screens, UI functionality, implementing anything that the user sees or does). This also involves back-end development (software architecture, telemetry communication, MCC communication, VEGA integration).
            <br><br>
            What I Worked On:
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing geosampling data</li>
                <li>Developing photo capture features with the HoloLens including saving/loading</li>
                <li>Integrating UI developed by the design team</li>
                <li>Collaborated with others to integrate voice commands with geosampling</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
