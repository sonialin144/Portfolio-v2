        <p>This is a group project done by 4 students. Won Best Environment at the XR @ Michigan 2023 Student Showcase.
            <br><br>We want to help users destress from their everyday lives by creating a novel peaceful environment for users to relax in. Our app places users on a subway train that stops at stations at various tranquil locations; throughout the app, users can record their thoughts and feelings in a journal. This app is intended for teenagers and young adults who are stressed out from their daily lives. 
            <br><br>We built this for the Meta Quest 2 / Rift / Rift S in Unity and used Blender to model all of our customized assets.
            <br><br>In our app, we have three different stations that the user can explore. For each station, we’ve implemented a corresponding activity with the intention of supporting our users wellbeing. Among these, we’ve included expressive journaling, ambient exploration, and self reflection.
            <br><br>When the user first enters our application, they will be greeted by the conductor, where they receive a ticket to aboard our train. They are then introduced to the home station, Metro Dawn. From here, the user can get on the train and travel to the different stations. On the train, the user can use our journal feature to record themselves expressing their thoughts and feelings for the day, and just let out whatever is on their mind.
        </p>

            What I Worked On:
            <ul>
                <li>Programmed journaling feature using Meta Voice SDK</li>
                <li>Programmed scene transitions, animations, interactions</li>
                <li>Implemented sound effects</li>
                <li>3D modeled and rigged custom VR hands</li>
                <li>3D modeled fish in underwater environment</li>
                <li>Designed journal UI</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        </p>

            Our second main attraction is the underwater environment, where users can relax and destress while swimming around and enjoying the tropical view. Here, users can also receive sensory feedback from interacting with different sea life and plants.

            Lastly, our final station features a chatting area where users can anonymously talk with other online users. Currently, due to our short development time, our prototype does not feature multiplayer, but we have implemented an interaction here where users are able to make wishes and reflect on themselves under the sky.
